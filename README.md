Number Maze

- Built on backbone.js, underscore.js, jquery, snap.js (external open source)
- Snap.js enables the sliding menu popularized by Facebook
-- on touch screens (mobile and desktops), you can slide to reveal the menu
-- on any screens with a mouse, you can simply drag

How to play:
You have 'want mod' -> you want your sum to be modulus this value equal to 0
You have 'avoid mod' -> you want to avoid having your sum be modulus this value equal to 0
You have 60 seconds
Try to get the highest score, you get a score for submitting whenever you have a sum modulus 'want mod' equals to 0

**
Still a work in progress, but it can be played.
Have yet to decide what happens once you hit a score that you are suppose to avoid. If you open your console (F12), a message is revealed whenever you hit a mod that you should avoid.
